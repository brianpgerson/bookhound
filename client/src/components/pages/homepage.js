					<h5>This section is a long one, but let's be honest: you're here because you like to read</h5>
				</section>
				<section className="row pad-bottom">
					<div className="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
						<h4 className="text-center">Why does this exist?</h4>
						<p>
							Because humans are creatures of convenience, not of habit. And, while there are plenty of companies out there more than happy to parlay that need into on-demand valet services or laundry pickup, bookhound seeks to be a little more aspirational. If it is constantly, surprisingly, delightfully convenient to have and read new books, I know I will read more. My hope is that you will too.
						</p>

				</section>
				<section className="row pad-bottom">
					<div className="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
						<h4 className="text-center">How does bookhound know when to withdraw funds?</h4>
						<p>
							Two things make it easy. One is an algorithm that analyzes your cashflow and tells bookhound, "hey, this is a good time to withdraw". I'd give you the details, but you'd have to buy me a beer first. Secondly, the app is buying books, which, despite their unmatched intangible value, are usually less than $20. bookhound doesn't have to withdraw much at a time to get you books with satisfying frequency, which simplifies matters considerably.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section className="row pad-bottom">
					<div className="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
						<h4 className="text-center">How does bookhound pick the books?</h4>
						<p>
							For now, it's simple. You pick a wishlist of books, and we choose from those. Soon (hopefully *very* soon), bookhound will offer curated lists in various categories, which you'll be able to customize, for example, by excluding books you already own.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section className="row pad-bottom">
					<div className="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
						<h4 className="text-center">How much does it cost?</h4>
						<p>
							For now and, unless something drastic changes, forevermore, bookhound will be free to join. Each purchase will cost precisely the cost of the book + shipping, along with a buck fifty to defray the costs of bookhound's existence. You'll be able to see shipped orders on your profile page, so you'll always know how much a book cost.

				<section className="row pad-bottom">
					<div className="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
						<h4 className="text-center">Why Amazon? Why not support (insert bookseller)?</h4>
						<p>
							Because books are not actually an easy thing to programmatically buy for other people â€” even from Amazon, it turns out. But for now, it's the best way to get something started and prove the concept. I love my local bookstore too, and don't think bookhound will stop me from stopping by for spontaneous purchases.
